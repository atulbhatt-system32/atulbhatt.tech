But if you wanna customise things here and there inside the template, you can do it. But the requirements for that are as follows:

- React JS
- React Router
- SaSS
- Tailwind CSS

- Single data source with a proper structure to help you make it easy to customise and make it your own.
- Well structured. So you can easily understand what's going on.
- A separate skills page where there is a option to see how many skills you have, that matches with the required skills if someone wants to hire you.
- Similarly a separate project page where a person can check how suitable are you for a project by matching the skills and functionalities you implemented in them. Or maybe just check them and see them in action if they are live.
  The project section is very well segregated.
- It also offers content page. Nowdays, people are doing so much more than just development. If you write blogs, do podcasts, or have a youtube channel, you can add it to the content page which all have unique sections of their own.
- An easy configuration object if you don't want to show a particular page, or disable dark theme (ðŸ˜… Idk why) but yeah it's there. - Testimonials Section have video testimonials option too. They give more authenticity. Don't they?
